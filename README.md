# Synferno

This codebase contains the software and hardware designs that allow Tautology's flame effects to be controlled by MIDI devices. Synferno is an group of flame effects that are sequenced, synchronized, and controlled by DJs and other electronic musicians. Beats and heats.

A synferno system consists of a console and one or more flame effects. The default configuration has one flame effect each on the right and left channels. Each flame effect has a pass-through SpeakOn port, which allows for multiple flame effects to be connected in series on stage left and stage right.

# Console

The synferno console is the device that sits in the DJ booth and allows the performer to synchronize her hardware to the flame effects.

## Console Physical Layout

The back of the console has six interface components:

* One DIN-5 MIDI input port
* One knob potentiometer for calibration
* One rocker-style power switch
* One IEC power socket
* Two SpeakOn connectors to drive the flame effects

The top of the console has ten interface components:

* One blue LED indicating power supply status
* One green LED indicating microcontroller status
* One yellow LED indicating MIDI synchronization status
* One orange LED indicating controller arming status
* One red LED indicating fire control signal status
* One rotary potentiometer to set poof frequency
* One slide potentiometer to set flame duration
* One key-lock switch to ensure user is permitted to run console
* One arming switch to ensure user wants to run console
* One big red button to initiate manual fire control signalling

# Flame Effects

The design of the flame effects closely parallels the design of [Mike Dodds' *Amplifire* design](https://github.com/the-magister/amplifire). Please reference his codebase for hardware designs of the flame effects.

When the flame effects are being used as *Synferno* accumulators, they are connected as with any other sound system component: with locking, interference-resistant SpeakOn cables. When the flame effects are being used as *Amplifire* accumulators, they are controlled via WiFi and infrared sensors.
