/* 
 * When the solenoid (an inductor) is powered up, it pulls significantly more (3x?) amperage than the
 * steady-state amperage.  Likewise, when turned off, the inductor will generate power from the magnetic
 * field collapse event.  Thus, if you turn off the solenoid mid-powerup, you'll end up with a weird
 * electrical and physical state.  A partially open solenoid will yield abberant firing.  
 * 
 * Thus, we impose a cap on the duty cycle keeping with the hardware limit.
